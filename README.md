# OCR Pro Landing Page

This is the landing page for OCR Pro - a smart document scanner application.

## Dashboard Image Setup

âœ… **Current Setup:**
The dashboard screenshot is already configured and located at:
- **Path:** `./images/Screenshot 2025-09-02 004903.png`
- **Status:** Ready to display in the laptop mockup

## For Vercel Deployment

When deploying to Vercel, you have two options:

**Option 1: Keep in images folder (Current)**
- No changes needed - will work as-is on Vercel
- Path: `./images/Screenshot 2025-09-02 004903.png`

**Option 2: Move to public folder (Recommended)**
- Create a `public` folder in your project root
- Move the image from `images/` to `public/`
- Update path in `landing.html` to `/Screenshot 2025-09-02 004903.png`
- This follows Vercel's static file conventions

3. **Fallback behavior:**
   - If the image is not found, a beautiful placeholder will show instead
   - The placeholder includes dashboard-style statistics and branding
